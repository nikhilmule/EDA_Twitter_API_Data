# EDA_Twitter_API_Data

## __Introduction__

- ### The main goal of this analysis is extract the data on the "savetheplanet" using the twitter API.
- ### For extracting the data python wrapper "Twython" is used here.
- ### After extracting the data further analysis is done on the data like tweet source, time, day.
- ### Additionally in this "TextBlob" library is used to indentify the subjectivity and polarity of the tweet.

### In this Project mainly used libraries are pandas, seaborn, matplot, NLTK, wordcloud, TextBlob, re, numpy

## __Conculsion__

-  ### From the analysis it is estimated that objective tweets are more on the topic of "savetheplanet"
-  ### It is observed that the iphone and android are most commonly used device types.
-  ### Where as sunday is most active day and where evening 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM are maximum using time of the twitter.
-  ### Most objective tweets are from the Iphone user and where as more subjective tweets are from the Android users.
-  ### Common subjective words are funny, christmas, actually living, decoration
-  ### where most common objective words are oceansaredying, savetheoceans, mankind, earthoceans

### In final conculsion in my words i would like to conculde that we are polluting the oceans at very high rate by dumping plastics, industrial and human waste, overfishing. Which results the distrubance of ecosystem.
